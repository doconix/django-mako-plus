Django on Jython
================

.. index:: Jython, Java, JVM

Jython_ is an implementation of Python that runs on the Java platform (JVM).

.. _jython: http://www.jython.org/

If you want to use Jython (which supports only Python 2.7 at the time of this
writing), you must use Django 1.11.x (the last series to support Python 2).
Jython support may be readded to Django if a Python 3 compatible Jython is
released.
