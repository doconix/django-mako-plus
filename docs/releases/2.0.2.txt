Django 2.0.2 release notes
==========================

*February 1, 2018*

Django 2.0.2 fixes a security issue and several bugs in 2.0.1.

CVE-2018-6188: Information leakage in ``AuthenticationForm``
============================================================

A regression in Django 1.11.8 made
:class:`~django.contrib.auth.forms.AuthenticationForm` run its
``confirm_login_allowed()`` method even if an incorrect password is entered.
This can leak information about a user, depending on what messages
``confirm_login_allowed()`` raises. If ``confirm_login_allowed()`` isn't
overridden, an attacker enter an arbitrary username and see if that user has
been set to ``is_active=False``. If ``confirm_login_allowed()`` is overridden,
more sensitive details could be leaked.

This issue is fixed with the caveat that ``AuthenticationForm`` can no longer
raise the "This account is inactive." error if the authentication backend
rejects inactive users (the default authentication backend, ``ModelBackend``,
has done that since Django 1.10). This issue will be revisited for Django 2.1
as a fix to address the caveat will likely be too invasive for inclusion in
older versions.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed hidden content at the bottom of the "The install worked successfully!"
  page for some languages (:ticket:`28885`).

* Fixed incorrect foreign key nullification if a model has two foreign keys to
  the same model and a target model is deleted (:ticket:`29016`).

* Fixed regression in the use of ``QuerySet.values_list(..., flat=True)``
  followed by ``annotate()`` (:ticket:`29067`).

* Fixed a regression where a queryset that annotates with geometry objects
  crashes (:ticket:`29054`).

* Fixed a regression where ``contrib.auth.authenticate()`` crashes if an
  authentication backend doesn't accept ``request`` and a later one does
  (:ticket:`29071`).

* Fixed a regression where ``makemigrations`` crashes if a migrations directory
  doesn't have an ``__init__.py`` file (:ticket:`29091`).

* Fixed crash when entering an invalid uuid in ``ModelAdmin.raw_id_fields``
  (:ticket:`29094`).
