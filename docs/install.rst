Installation
==============================

This section shows how to install DMP in a new project as well as an existing project.

What kind of project do you have?

    :maxdepth: 1

    install_new
    install_existing


Minimal DMP
-------------------------------------

A common question from users is how to do a minimal installation with just one feature.  For example, you might need to use DMP to render Mako templates in an otherwise vanilla Django project.  Or you might only need DMP's routing-by-convention.

This section shows how to go cafeteria-style with DMP.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    install_as_renderer
    install_as_router
    install_app_specific
