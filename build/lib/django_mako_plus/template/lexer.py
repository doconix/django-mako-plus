###  DMP hook for expression filters. This allows DMP
###  to filter expressions ${...} after all other filters
###  have been run.
###
###  Currently, the use of this hook is HTML autoescaping.
###  Django autoescapes by default, while Mako does not.
###  DMP injects autoescaping to be consistent with Django.
